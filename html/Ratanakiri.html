      <h1 class="sr">Ratanakiri</h1>
      <p class="sr1">Ratanakiri (Khmer: រតនគិរី, UNGEGN: Rôtânôkĭri, ALA-LC: Ratanagirī [rɔətanakiriː]; lit. 'Gem Mountains') is a province of northeast Cambodia. It borders the provinces of Mondulkiri to 
        the south and Stung Treng to the west and the countries of Laos (Attapeu) and Vietnam (Gia Lai and Kon Tum) to the north and east, respectively. The province extends from the mountains of the Annamite Range 
        in the north, across a hilly plateau between the Tonlé San and Tonlé Srepok rivers, to tropical deciduous forests in the south. In recent years, logging and mining have scarred Ratanakiri's environment, long known for its beauty.

        For over a millennium, Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland Khmer Loeu people, who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia. During the region's early history, its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as slaves
         by neighboring empires. The slave trade economy ended during the French colonial era, but a harsh Khmerization campaign after Cambodia's independence again threatened Khmer Loeu ways of life. The Khmer Rouge built its
          headquarters in the province in the 1960s, and bombing during the Vietnam War devastated the region. Today, rapid development in the province is altering traditional ways of life.
        
        Ratanakiri is sparsely populated; its 184,000 residents make up just over 1% of the country's total population. Residents generally live in villages of 20 to 60 families and engage in subsistence shifting agriculture. Ratanakiri is 
        among the least developed provinces of Cambodia. Its infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak. Health indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor; men's life expectancy is 39 years, and women's is 43 years. Education
         levels are also low, with just under half of the population illiterate.Ratanakiri has been occupied since at least the Stone or Bronze Age, and trade between the region's highlanders and towns along the Gulf of Thailand dates to at 
         least the 4th century A.D.[3] The region was invaded by Annamites, the Cham, the Khmer, and the Thai during its early history, but no empire ever brought the area under centralized control.[1] From the 13th century or earlier until the
          19th century, highland villages were often raided by Khmer, Lao, and Thai slave traders.[4] The region was conquered by local Laotian rulers in the 18th century and then by the Thai in the 19th century.[5] The area was incorporated into 
          French Indochina in 1893, and colonial rule replaced slave trading.[6] The French built huge rubber plantations, especially in Labansiek (present-day Banlung); indigenous workers were used for construction and rubber harvesting.[1] While under
           French control, the land comprising present-day Ratanakiri was transferred from Siam (Thailand) to Laos and then to Cambodia.[7] Although highland groups initially resisted their colonial rulers, by the end of the colonial era in 1953 they had been subdued.[6]

         Ratanakiri Province was created in 1959 from land that had been the eastern area of Stung Treng Province.[1] The name Ratanakiri (រតនគិរី) is formed from the Khmer words រតនៈ (rôtânô "gem" from Sanskrit ratna) and គិរី (kĭri "mountain" from Sanskrit
          giri), describing two features for which the province is known.[8] During the 1950s and 1960s, Norodom Sihanouk instituted a development and Khmerization campaign in northeast Cambodia that was designed to bring villages under government control,
           limit the influence of insurgents in the area, and "modernize" indigenous communities.[9] Some Khmer Loeu were forcibly moved to the lowlands to be educated in Khmer language and culture, ethnic Khmer from elsewhere in Cambodia were moved into the province, 
           and roads and large rubber plantations were built.[10] After facing harsh working conditions and sometimes involuntary labor on the plantations, many Khmer Loeu left their traditional homes and moved farther from provincial towns.[11] In 1968, tensions led to 
           an uprising by the Brao people in which several Khmer were killed.[12] The government responded harshly, torching settlements and killing hundreds of villagers.</p>

On to Kinchaan, where we met some local guys keen to show off their cliff jumping skills, although i was happy to remain dry after my last cliff jumping experience ended in hospitalisation, with a torn medial knee ligament.
