      <h1 class="sr">WelCome To Mondul Kiri</h1>
      <p class="sr1">Mondulkiri (Khmer: មណ្ឌលគិរី, UNGEGN: Môndôlkĭri, ALA-LC: Maṇḍalagirī [mɔndɔl.kiriː]; lit. 'Center of Mountains') is a province (khaet) of Cambodia. Bordering the provinces of
         Kratié to the west, Stung Treng to the northwest, Ratanakiri to the north, and the country of Vietnam to the east and south. It is the most sparsely populated province in the country despite
          being the largest in land area. The province was
         established in 1961 from the eastern part of Kratié province. The capital is the town of Senmonorom.The province's symbol is the kouprey which is also Cambodia's national mammal.In 1960 Mondulkiri was created out 
         of Kratié province by order of King Norodom Sihanouk. Saen Monorom was set up as the capital in 1962. During the Vietnam War in the late 1960s, Mondulkiri was home to three bases of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam
          which resulted in numerous incursions and bombings by US forces. About 1970 the area fell under Khmer Rouge domination. Subsequently, much of the populace was forcibly removed to Koh Nhek (Kaoh Nheaek) district to provide labor for 
          rice farming. Schools, hospitals and even entire villages were destroyed. As many as half of the people in the province died during the forced relocation in the 1970s.

         The Bunong people appear to have lived in the provincial area for about 2000 years, but there is little documentation until France colonized Cambodia in 1864. Like other people in the province, the Bunong were displaced in the 1970s and only allowed to return to their traditional homeland in the 1980s.
         Adventurous travelers beeline to the hill country of Mundulkiri Province in Cambodia's far east for wildlife spotting, village life, trail-bike tours, and the Elephant Valley Project.

         The most famous tourist attraction in the region, the Elephant Valley Project offers visitors a chance to walk with the sanctuary's elephants (no riding allowed) while providing an opportunity for local mahouts (elephant keepers) to earn a wage that doesn't involve overworking their elephants.
         
         For adrenaline-junkies, the Mayura zipline course skims right over the top of Bou Sra waterfall, while bird-watchers and wildlife spotters will want to take a tour into Seima Protected Forest, home to gibbons, the endangered black-shanked douc langurs, and plentiful birdlife.
         The small town of Sen Monorom is the main base for travelers in Mundulkiri and within easy day-tripping distance to all of the tourist attractions.</p>
         <h1 class="sr">1.Bou Sra Waterfall</h1>
         <img src="../image/Bou sra.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
          <p class="sr1">Bousra waterfall is located in Pich Chenda district about 43 kilometers northeast of Mondulkiri provincial town, Sen Monorom. Busra is considered by many to be the most beautiful waterfall in Mondulkiri. The waterfall is divided into three stages:
             First Stage: The waterfall fall is 8 to 12 meters high and 15 meters wide in rainy season and 10 to 15 meters wide in dry season.
             Second Stage: The waterfall fall is 15 to 20 meters high and 20 meters wide in rainy season and 18 to 25 meters high and 13 meters wide in dry season. The second stage is 150 meters from the first stage.
            Third Stage: The speed of waterfall is faster than the second stage. This stage cannot be reached because it is in the thick forest. There are no marked paths and dangerous wildlife inhabits the area.
             The double-drop waterfall is very popular with the locals who use it as a bathing and picnic spot. Its top level is around 10m in height, and the lower level drops down 25m to the gorge. It is in a scenic and pristine setting and offers great photo ops. Nearby is the ethnic Phnong village called Pichinda which has a small guesthouse. Some snacks are available at the falls, but bring food if you would like something more substantial. Then we head northeast to Bou Sra. We never rode north on this road before and I am surprised that right behind the first hill it is getting rougher than most we have seen yesterday. We cross a small river on an improvised bridge and are charged 500 Riel each by a bunch of kids.
             After that the road is getting somewhat smoother but still requires a lot of attention. There are deep grooves in the road, most likely left behind my heavy cars. Once you get into one of those it leaves you with only very few options other than just following it hoping not to get stuck. Yet the ground is solid and provides good grip for the tires. We keep going and after some time we do not see settlements anymore. The forest is relatively dense and in some places impenetrable. Both of us have to restart the bike a number of times and while we proceed with moderate speed it remains a challenge in many places to maneuver those relatively heavy bikes.
            The way I start this bike many times is I put it on the stand, climb on the moto and start it from this relatively comfortable position, before I flap the stand and go. However, I realize that the stand is about to break off and can hardly support the bike anymore. The road is getting tougher; there are many rocks and countless obstacles, sometimes forcing us to ride next to the road. And hills are pretty steep in some instances. Overall we move quite slowly. After about 40 minutes we have a break. I try to figure how Pongro is riding down those hills and ask him. I learn that he controls the speed entirely with the clutch.
             I am about to suggest using a lower gear. To demonstrate how he does it he takes the clutch clever and holds it tight. Oddly, at precisely this moment the clutch cable breaks. I does not take us long to realize that it is impossible to ride this bike without clutch. Ironically, today is the first day we go without the heavy set of tools and spare parts we usually carry and which includes a clutch cable. Pongro is still confident that we can manage to fix the bike here. Once in while people pass on small, old Honda's, sometimes badly overloaded but always very skillfully finding the way between all those rocks.
           We learn that the way to Bou Sra is still longer than the way back to Sen Monorom. Furthermore the road is getting tougher from here. And it is very unlikely we find somebody there who can fix the bike.One of those guys stops for some time and Pongro borrows some tools and wire in order to try fixing the moto. The Phnong guy joins and for some time they try hard. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that this won't work out.
