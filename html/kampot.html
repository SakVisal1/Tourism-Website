        <h1 class="sr">Welcome To Kampot</h1>
        <p class="sr1">
            If you're after Kampot pepper, Sothy's Pepper Farm (read our full review here) is the best one to visit, but it's actually much closer to Kep than to Kampot, as are the lake and salt fields, so if you're going to both towns, we'd recommend doing the countryside tour from Kep instea
            It is very quiet and calm in the 50,000 inhabitant town of Kampot. Kampot is the capital of the province of the same name and is well known for its more or less well-preserved buildings from the French colonial era.First of all: You shouldn’t expect to find classic tourist attractions 
            in Kampot. Rather, it is the relaxing flair that makes this town a worthwhile stop.
            We begin in the heart of Kampot’s old town, the French quarter close to the riverbank. Cambodia was under French colonial rule for almost one hundred years. The architectural remnants from the colonial era still remain – although the plaster is crumbling on many corners.

            It is best to take a bit of time to explore the side alleys – where you can discover some exciting photo motifs. You should not expect a well-kept city in Kampot, but the centre definitely has a lot of flair, that much is certain.
            You stay right in the centre of Kampot (in a very peaceful alleyway), and it is perfect for exploring the town on foot from the hotel. Due to the architecture of the houses, some rooms are a little dim, but are very comfortably furnished. In any case, the value for money is excellent.

            We really enjoyed the breakfast. Served in a beautiful lobby, it is the perfect way to start the day. Our conclusion: If you want to stay in the centre of Kampot (which we would recommend), then this hotel is a fantastic choice.</p>
            <h1 class="sr">1.Rabbit Island</h1>
            <img src="../image/Rabbit island.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%"> 
            <p class="sr1">Twenty to 40 minutes by local boat from Kep is Rabbit Island. A place of white sandy beaches and coconut palms, it is an idyllic day trip from either Kampot or Kep. Although the waters are clear there is no coral, but don't let that put you off donning a mask and flippers.
               Rabbit Island is a place of psychedelic fish.
               There are some beach bars in which you can stay the night for about $10, though conditions are very basic. Seafood here is great. Most likely when you order crab on Rabbit Island, your restaurateur will wade out into the tepid ocean and haul your lunch directly from one of the crab pots.
               It doesn't come fresher than that. A boat for the return trip costs $20. Guesthouses offer a package for $7, but you won't get to pick your own boat, beach, and crab buddies.
              Koh Tonsay, or the Rabbit Island, is the choice of visitors who would like to experience the beaches in Kampot. It comes close to the ideal tropical island, with its fine white sand, coconut palms on the beach, basic accommodations, and few tourists. There are, however, a few local 
              families living there.
              Things to Do in Rabbit Island
              Rabbit Island is undeveloped, and the only thing that one can do here is swimming, beachcombing, and walking around. The water is shallow and there are no corals, so diving is out. Snorkeling may be good though, for there are many-colored fish in the area.
              One of the best things to do here is to eat seafood, especially the crabs. Enjoy it fresh off the ocean every time you order. For those who love to get physical, the whole island is only around six kilometers around and can be walked in three hours and ran in less than one or two hours. The views 
              include fishing communities and the occasional wildlife and household animals.
               How to Get to Rabbit Island
               The island is 20-40 minutes by boat (around $20, return) from Kep, which is around two hours from Kampot. Trips are best made through a local travel operator or through the hotel or guesthouse.
              Rabbit Island is perfect for those who love quiet and basic accommodations (beachside, unreliable electricity, mosquito nets) are available for only around $7-8 per night.</p>
              <h1 class="sr">2.Kampong Trach</h1>
              <img src="../image/kampong trach.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%"> 
              <p class="sr1">The town of Kampong Trach, Kampot is a small one but still offers enough attractions to the tourists. Here you would find various limestone caves and tubes in a nearby mountain. Once there was also a large cave in the center of the mountain whose roof had collapsed and thus a small enclosed 
                jungle had been formed in the area. In the caves you would find various pagodas and caves which are excellent sightseeing attractions. Therefore, do not forget to bring a flashlight and always a pair of good walking shoes.
                 You would find various small mountain wells at the foot of the mountain in Kampong Trach, Kampot. These are worshipped by not only the local Cambodians but also the Chinese and the Vietnamese people. One of the wells is about 30 meters in diameter and contains different colored soil. The other smaller wells
                 have stones which look like animal figures. The large well has a trench which leads to the Viel Sre Muoy Roy and Thma Dos wells of Kampot.</p>
                 <h1 class="sr">3.Phnom Chhornk</h1>
                 <img src="../image/Phnom chhnork.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%"> 
                 <p class="sr1">The limestone caves near Kampot house exotic rock formations and Buddhist shrines. When you plan to visit these caves near Kampot, make sure that you are carrying a torch and have put on proper trekking shoes.  
                 The first caves that you would come across in this area are that of the caves of Phnom Chhnork. The first of these caves have pre-Angkorian ruins within the limestone caves. You would find various brick structures of 5th century AD amongst the stalagmites and stalactites that are formed within the cave. You would 
                 also find 4th century structures which are the evidences of the state of Funan. While you enter the cave you would find limestone formations in the shapes of elephants. The entrance of the second cave lies about 300 meters from the first cave and to reach there you have to climb various piles of rocks and go through small openings. 
                   Caves near Kampot in Cambodia further include the cave at Phnom Sla Ta'aun Plain which is smaller in comparison to the other caves but still it is attractive to the climbers. The interesting things that you can find here are a small shrine as well as a huge rock that is balanced in a hole on the ceiling of the cave. 
                  </p>
                  <h1 class="sr">4.Kampot Durain</h1>
                  <img src="../image/Kampot Durain.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%"> 
                  <p class="sr1">The reason you might have been offered so much of the spiky, strong-smelling fruit known as durian while enjoying the Teuk Chheu rapids is because of the proximity of the plantations, which line either side of the road en route. Kampot durian is famous throughout Cambodia for its flavor and sweetness.
                    It is deemed superior to Thai durian by Khmer connoisseurs (Prime Minister Hun Sen among them) and the price reflects this it can cost twice as much as its imported counterpart. Many foreigners do not enjoy the strong taste and smell of this strange fruit, with its creamy yellow flesh encased in brown spiked skin, but those who do will find the cheapest (and tastiest) durian in the Kingdom in Kampot.
