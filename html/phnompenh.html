      <h1 class="sr">Welcome To Phnom Penh</h1>
      <p class="sr1">Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s busy capital, sits at the junction of the Mekong and Tonlé Sap rivers. It was a hub for both the
         Khmer Empire and French colonialists. On its walkable riverfront, lined with parks, restaurants and bars, are the ornate Royal Palace,
          Silver Pagoda and the National Museum, displaying artifacts from around the country. At the city’s heart is the massive, art deco Central Market.
          Phnom Penh succeeded Angkor Thom as the capital of the Khmer nation but was abandoned several times before being reestablished in 1865 by King Norodom.
           The city formerly functioned as a processing center, with textiles, pharmaceuticals, machine manufacturing, and rice milling. Its chief assets, however,
            were cultural. Institutions of higher learning included the Royal University of Phnom Penh (established in 1960 as Royal Khmer University), with schools of 
            engineering, fine arts, technology, and agricultural sciences, the latter at Chamkar Daung, a suburb. Also located in Phnom Penh were the Royal University of Agronomic
             Sciences and the Agricultural School of Prek Leap.[9] The city was nicknamed the "Pearl of Asia" for its early 20th century colonial French architecture, which included 
             Art Deco works.[10] Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is
              noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497.[11] It regained its
               capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving colonial-era buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.
          On the banks of the Tonlé Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population.[4] The Greater Phnom Penh area
           includes the nearby Ta Khmau city and some districts of Kandal province.Phnom Penh also has its own dialect of Khmer. Speakers of the Phnom Penh dialect often elide syllables, which has
           earned it a reputation for being lazy speech. Phnom Penh is also known for its influence on New Khmer Architecture. Phnom Penh is notable for Ka tieu Phnom Penh, its variation on rice noodle soup, 
           a dish available in sit-down cafes as well as street cafes.The city hosts a number of music events throughout the city. Indie bands have grown in number due also in part to the emergence of private music 
           schools such as SoundsKool Music (also operating in the city of Siem Reap), and Music Arts School (registered as a non-governmental organization). The Cambodian fishing dance originated in Phnom Penh at the Royal University of Fine Arts in the 1960s.[45]
           The Cambodian fishing dance originated from Phnom Penh.
           The two most visited museums in the city are the National Museum, which is the country's leading historical and archaeological museum, and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a former Khmer Rouge prison. The National Museum hosts 
           celebrations of Cambodian dance and music, including a popular classic Apsara dance show of traditional folk dances as well as original creations.</p>
           <h1 class="sr">1. Royal Palace and Silver Pagoda</h1>
           <img src="../image/Royal Palace.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
           <p class="sr1">
            The Royal Palace and Silver Pagoda are set adjacent to each other, spanning 174,870 square metres of breathtaking Khmer architecture and lush greenery. Although the king of Cambodia still occasionally resides in The Royal Palace
             (if the blue royal flag is flying, the king is in residence), visitors can explore several buildings within the palace grounds from US$6.50 and guided tours are available from around US$10.
             Located in Sisowath Quay, highlights at the Royal Palace include the Throne Hall and Moonlight Pavilion. Meanwhile, entrance to the Silver Pagoda is free of charge, where you can visit the Emerald Buddha, 
            which dates back to the 17th century and is adorned with Baccarat crystals.</p>
            <h1 class="sr">2. National Museum of Cambodia</h1>
           <img src="../image/National Museum.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
           <p class="sr1">National Museum of Cambodia in Phnom Penh is the country’s largest archaeological and cultural history museum. The museum shows you the cultural side of Cambodian history, which dates back to the 4th century.
             Inaugurated in 1920 as the Musée Albert Sarraut during the French colonial period, the museum's reopening was initiated by George Groslier, a famed author, historian and architect, who also served as the museum's first curator.
            In 1951, the French conceded the control of the museum to the Cambodians when it came to be known as Musée National de Phnom Penh. Later in 1966, Chea Thay Seng became the museum’s first Cambodian director. It barely survived serious
             damage during the devastating Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979, and the museum and its precincts underwent a major refurbishment in the 1990s with contributions from the Australian Government and other patrons.
             Backed by the Cambodian Department of Museums, the museum’s role is now not just confined to preserving its exhibits that include one of the largest collections of Khmer artefacts in the world, but also to oversee other museums in the country.</p>
             <h1 class="sr">3. Central Market (Phsar Thmey)</h1>
            <img src="../image/Phsar Thmey.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
            <p class="sr1">Phnom Penh Central Market, also known as Phsar Thmey which means ‘New Market’, is one of the Cambodian capital's major landmarks. Whether you’re a shopping enthusiast who wants to gauge your haggling skills or a tourist interested in being 
              a part of the bustling crowd, or just want to explore the amazing architectural wonders of the city, the Central Market is a place not to miss out during your stay in the city.
            Designed by Desbois and erected in Art Deco style, Central Market was the largest of its kind in Asia when it was constructed in 1937, during the French colonial era. In an effort to preserve this unique architecture, Central Market underwent 
              a renovation with funds from the French Developmental Agency before it was reopened to the public in 2011.</p>
              <h1 class="sr">4. Cambodian Living Arts – Apsara and Traditional Khmer Dance</h1>
              <img src="../image/Apsara Dance.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
              <p class="sr1">Cambodian Living Arts is a non-profit organisation that hosts Apsara and traditional Khmer dance performances at the National Museum of Cambodia. Tickets are priced from US$15 and shows are held on Mondays, Wednesdays and weekends from 7pm onwards
                . The organisation preserves traditional Khmer dance that dates back to the 18th century but was almost lost under the Khmer Rouge regime.
              Cambodian Living Arts revived the art by gathering surviving master artists to train and pass on their knowledge to younger generations. The troupe comprises live singers and musicians in traditional Khmer costumes, performing eight classical 
                dances of ethnic minorities from all over Cambodia</p>
                <h1 class="sr">5. Children Park Koh Pich Amusement Park</h1>
                <img src="../image/Childern park.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
                  <p class="sr1">Children Park Koh Pich is an amusement park at the South Sisowath Quay in Phnom Penh. It can get quite packed and offers colourful ways to have fun, including a rollercoaster, a roller skating area with a big wavy floor section and lots of booths
                   where punters try to burst balloons with darts.
                  It is, of course, nowhere near as extravagant as Disneyland, but this is a great place for people-watching, especially watching the locals enjoying life with friends and family – a reminder to outsiders that there is now much more to Cambodia than the grim 
                  history of the Killing Fields. </p>
                  <h1 class="sr">6. Mekong Island (Koh Dach) near Phnom Penh</h1>
                  <img src="../image/Mekong Island.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
                   <p class="sr1">Mekong Island is where to head to if you wish to take a break from the hustle and bustle of Phnom Penh and venture into a world of peace and tranquillity. The island is about 15 km north of the city centre. Bounded by views of rice paddies, vegetable
                   farms and fruit orchards, Mekong Island not only serves as a venue for an enjoyable day trip or picnic but also enables you to experience the country’s authentic culture at its best.
                  This island occupies an area of about 10 hectares of land and is one of the prominent centres of traditional handicrafts in Cambodia, with artisans engaged in silk weaving, pottery, woodcarving and dyeing in its villages. One of the best ways to get there by cruise
                   boat from Sisowath Quay in Phnom Penh (usually a 2.5-hour round trip). You can also hire a tuk-tuk from the city to the Japanese Bridge, from where you can continue your journey to the island by ferry.</p>
                   <h1 class="sr">7. Phnom Penh Independence Monument</h1>
                  <img src="../image/Independence.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
                   <p class="sr1">Independence Monument, or Vimean Ekareach as it is referred to in Khmer, is a majestic structure that dominates Phnom Penh city centre. Independence Monument was primarily erected to mark the liberation of the country from the French, who ruled Cambodia 
                    for almost a century from 1863 to 1953.
                     Built in 1958, and inaugurated in 1962 during the regime of Sangkum Reastr, this monument also serves as a proud testament to commemorate people who sacrificed their lives for the welfare of the country. The monument is captivating for its cool, serene atmosphere,
                     which in turn makes it a much sought-after destination. </p>
                     <h1 class="sr">8. Wat Phnom</h1>
                    <img src="../image/Wat Phnom.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
                    <p class="sr1">Wat Phnom is a temple that sits on a hill to the north of Phnom Penh. The temple was restored and reconstructed through several years, namely in 1434, 1806, 1894 and 1926.
                     Wat Phnom is a symbol of the Cambodian capital city and is regularly visited by local devotees who either come for prayers, bring small offerings, or participate in meditation.</p>
                     <h1 class="sr">9. Wat Ounalom</h1>
                    <img src="../image/Wat Ounalom.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
                   <p class="sr1">Wat Ounalom offers visitors an in-depth look into the spiritual teachings, philosophies and history of Buddhism in Cambodia. The most prominent and oldest of 5 pagodas in the country, Wat Ounalom is the centre of Cambodian Buddhism and serves as the abode of the Patriarch of the Mahanikai School of Buddhism.
                   Built in 1443 to enshrine an eyebrow hair (ounalom) of Lord Buddha, the shrine housed over 500 monks and the Buddhist Institute’s library that held over 30,000 titles in its collection before they were wiped out by the Khmer Rouge regime. The displayed Buddha’s eyebrow miraculously survived, making it the main draw among travellers 
                    from all over the world. A 10-minute walk from The Royal Palace, entrance to Wat Ounalom is free of charge.</p>
                    <h1 class="sr">10. Choeung Ek</h1>
                    <img src="../image/Choeung Ek.jfif" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
                    <p class="sr1">The Killing Fields, also known as Choeung Ek Memorial, is a bone-chilling reminder of Cambodia’s tragic history. About 17 km south of Phnom Penh City, it is one of the many killing fields or execution and burial grounds used by the Khmer Rouge regime during its rule of the country from 1975 to 1979.
                     Mass graves were discovered after the Khmer Rouge fled the city, leading to the construction of a Buddhist memorial for over 15,000 victims in The Killing Fields. Half-day tours to this memorial and S-21 Prison feature informative audio guides in many languages as well as testimony from survivors and guards of the regime.</p>
                    <h1 class="sr">11. Toul Sleng</h1>
                    <img src="../image/Tuol Sleng.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="sr6" width="100%">
                    <p class="sr1">Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum was formerly Tuol Svay Pray High School before it was turned into an interrogation, torture and execution centre by the Khmer Rouge regime. Also known as S-21 Prison, an estimated 17,000 Cambodians entered this notorious venue. Only 7 managed to survive until the end of the regime.
                     Most rooms have been left in the state they were found in January 1979, including classrooms divided into tiny cells. An essential stop while visiting Phnom Penh, Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum also displays 6,000 haunting portraits of its prisoners for travellers to understand the recent tragic Cambodian history. It's an intense experience touring the old prison and will no doubt give you plenty of food for thought.</p>
