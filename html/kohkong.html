             <h1 class="sr"> WelCome to Koh Kong</h1>
              <p class="sr1">The province is an increasingly popular gateway to Cambodia from Hat Lek in eastern Thailand (Trat), in part due to
               the reasonably direct access to the port and beach resort town of Sihanoukville. The border is at Cham Yeam, about 14 km from Koh Kong.
              Traveling to Koh Kong has been made easier, as bridges have been built, the first in 2002. The landmark Koh Kong Bridge was built by L.Y.P. 
               Group. It is the second longest bridge in Cambodia (Neak Loeung Bridge took the number one spot in 2015). The 1,900-meter crossing can be seen
              connecting provincial town of Koh Kong to Koh Kong Resort and the Thai border. In 2007 a new sealed road (National Route 48) was completed from the
              town to Sre Ambel on the Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville highway, including four new bridges donated by the Thai government. They opened in May 2008.
              Koh Kong lets you escape to a lesser-explored region on Cambodia's west coast. It's considered one of the country's greenest provinces, with the lush 
              and hilly slopes of the Cardamom Mountains meeting swathes of mangrove forests. You can boat out to the namesake Koh Kong island for an even more remote getaway.
              The Koh Kong Conservation Corridor stretches across an area within Cambodia's Cardamom Mountains, south of the border town of Koh Kong in the country's southwest.
              The highlands here, home to dense rainforest, winding rivers, and waterfalls, offer plenty of opportunities for hiking and boat tours.
              Head to the Tatai River if you want to simply soak up the lush surroundings and take a time out from life. Here, you'll find a handful of boutique eco-resorts scattered along
               the riverbank all offering activities such as day hikes and kayaking.
              Further south in the Cardamoms is the village of Chi Pat, an eco-tourism center with simple homestay and guesthouse accommodation and plenty of activities, ranging from multi-day 
              treks into the forested mountains to wildlife-spotting river boat trips.</p>

                  <p class="sr1">Koh Rong (Khmer: កោះរ៉ុង, Kaôh Rŏng [kɑh.roŋ]) is the second largest island of Cambodia. The word Rong might refer to an old term for "cave" or "tunnel" (Khmer: រូង, Rung [ruːŋ]),[2] although some islanders say Rong refers to a historical person's name. It can also refer to the Old Khmer word for shelter, adding up to Shelter Island.[3]

                    Located in Koh Kong Province in the kingdom of Cambodia about 25 km (16 mi), the island has an area of approximately 78 km2 (30 sq mi) and 43 km (27 mi) of its entire coastline of 61 km (38 mi) are beaches.[4] Four village communities exist on the island: Koh Tuich, Doeum D'keuw, Prek Svay and Sok San. In recent years the island has become home to an increasing but still moderate number
                     of foreign-run guesthouses and bungalow resorts. As the island's South-Eastern tip around Koh Tuich Village is the point of arrival it has developed into the island's largest settlement center. In absence of even the most basic infrastructure, transport by boat is required to all settlements and holiday resorts, which are scattered over the many beaches.[5]
                    
                    Koh Rong island is a relatively new commune, only established in 2000.[6] In order to boost development, Koh Rong has had a land concession issued by the Cambodian government. A Cambodian consortium, the Royal Group has been granted a 99-year lease. In 2008 it revealed plans to build "Asia's first environmentally planned resort island."</p>

                    <p class="sr1">Koh Sdech Koh Kong is located in Kirisakor district, about 81 kilometers south of Koh Kong provincial town. It attracts visitors from Sihanoukville and Sre Ambil district. Koh Sdech features a
                       long beach, and the sea is filled with a variety of fish. The site is excellent for snorkeling or scuba diving, as the water is clear, and an array of coral can be seen growing at the bottom of the sea. According
                        to legend, there once was a king who commanded an army on the island. Because there was no fresh water, the king searched everywhere to find some.
                       At last he found a rock near the sea. Thinking the rock might contain water, the king drew his sword and split open the rock, releasing an endless flow of water that local people still use today.
                       This small fishing village island sits at the half way mark between Ko Kong and Sihanoukville. Accommodation is available on the island, and for those interested in experiencing a totally unadulterated 
                       stay in a Cambodian fishing village, then this isn't a bad choice.
                      Located just a twenty minute boat-ride off the Cambodian coast, Ko Sdach is dominated by a sizeable fishing village that stretches along the side of the island that faces the mainland. While fishing 
                      is the mainstay of the local economy, the village also has a large ice-making plant, where you can watch it being made and ferried off by boat to the surrounding islands.
                       On the far side of the island lies the island's main beach, a somewhat rocky affair that sits beside the island's premiere karaoke bar. You can swim here if you wish and the water is crystal clear -- as an 
                       added bonus, while you're underwater you can't hear the karaoke.
                       Ko Sdach is surrounded by a bunch of other islands and the mainland, many of which have spectacular and totally deserted beaches -- all of which can be visited on daytrips by longtail from Ko Sdach.

                      <p class="sr1">Khun Chhang Khun Phen stupa sits on a rock in the middle of the sea tributary, about 1 kilometer from the provincial town. The stupa is 4 meters high and made of concrete. Because the site is small-only 40 square meters, including the stupa-it can accommodate only 10 to 15 visitors at a time. The stupa is about 1 kilometer from the provincial town. 
                        Koh Kong residents worship there and often visit the site on national holidays and traditional festivals. Khun Chhang Khun Phen is related to a Khmer legend. Once upon a time, there was villager's daughter named Thim, who was loved by a man named Khun Chhang. Khun Chhang was bold-headed and not very handsome, but his family was rich.Thim, however, did not love Khun 
                        Chhang, they became engaged and Khun Chhang married her.
                        She later betrayed her husband to love a commander named Khun Phen. When Khun Chhang learned of his wife's affair, he complained to the King. The King decided to cut Thim's body into two parts. After Thim died, Khun Chhang buried her at the same place where she was killed. Because he wanted her to be reincarnated, Khun Chhang put up a soul flag pole on the east bank of the
                         stream, facing where Thim was buried. Then he built a stupa 
                        in memory of their love. Later, the west bank of the stream was named Chetdey (a stupa) village, and the east bank was named Dangtung (a flage pole) village.

                            <p class="sr1">Kbal Chhay waterfall is located in Mondul Seima district, about 16 kilometers north of Koh Kong provincial town. Kbal Chhay or Koh Por is a natural site along a high mountain range and forest. To reach Koh Por, visitors travel along a stream amid beautiful scenery.Kbal Chhay gets its water from the Pursat stream. The waterfall is 10 meters high and 8 meters wide during the rainy season.
                               In dry season there is less water, so locals and tourists visit the site and relax under the big rocks that resemble a cave.

                              Kbal Chhay or Koh Por? Both? Apparently it is still not clear what name to give this waterfall located in Koh Kong province, Cambodia. Possibly Kbal Chhay is not used as often, now that Koh Kong is asserting itself on the tourist map. Kbal Chhay is also the name of neighboring Kampong Som province's only waterfall and as such a major tourist destination there. Operators naming this Koh Por makes sense
                               as it distinguishes it from the other Kbal Chhay.Accomadation is to be had in Koh Kong town as well as food. Nothing exists near the falls,
                               so bringing something with you is advisable. It's a great place to while away. 
                              
                              The waterfall of Kbal Chhay has many sources from the mountain rank at the seaside. The history of Kbal Chhay waterfall was found in 1960. Until 1963 Kbal Chhay arranged as the clean-water sources for providing to Sihanouk Ville, but the arrangement was failed became a hidden place for Khmer Rouge.In 1997, Kbal Chhay was changed to the developing zone. In 1998 Kbal Chhay was for bid by Kok An Company on 
                              constructing road and changing this site as tourist resort for local and international tourists. Nowadays, the Royal Government of Cambodia has changed his site as the clean-water sources for providing clean water to Sihanouk Ville.</p>
