      <h1 class="sr">Bokor Mountains</h1>
      <p class="sr1">Bokor Hill Station (Khmer: ស្ថានីយភ្នំបូកគោ, Sthaniy Phnum Bokkoŭ; French: Station d'altitude de Bokor) refers to a 
        collection of French colonial buildings constructed as a temperate mountain luxury resort and retreat for colonial residents in
         the early 1920s atop Bokor Mountain in Preah Monivong National Park, about 37 km (23 mi) west of Kampot in southern Cambodia. Abandoned 
         for long periods of time, modern infrastructure has made the location easily accessible as re-development is taking place. It was used as the 
         location for the final showdown of the movie City of Ghosts (2002) and the 2004 film R-Point.[1] To the north-east are the Povokvil Waterfalls.
         The Damrei Mountains have long been considered sacred and venerated by the Cambodians.

         The hill station was built as a resort by colonial French to help the French military who were stationed in that region. They were desperate for some relief from the oppressive
          heat that is characteristic to this part of the world. So in the early 1920's, Bokor Hill, a small resort town was built especially for the occupying French soldiers. Nine hundred 
          people died in nine months during the construction of the resort in this remote mountain location.[2]
         
         The centrepiece of the resort was the grand Bokor Palace Hotel, inaugurated in 1925. It has been complemented by the villa of the "Résident Supérieur", a post office (now demolished), and 
         a catholic church. It is also an important cultural site, showing how the colonial settlers spent their free time.
         
         Bokor Hill was abandoned first by the French in late 1940s, during the First Indochina War, because of local insurrections guided by the Khmer Issarak.
         
         It was only in 1962, for the reopening of the "Cité du Bokor", that a casino was established in the new hotels near the lake, (Hotels Sangkum and Kiri).
          Some buildings were added at this time: an annex for the palace, the mayor's office and a concrete parasol.
         
         The Bokor mountain was abandoned again in 1972, as Khmer Rouge took over the area. During the Vietnamese invasion in 1979, Khmer Rouge entrenched 
         themselves and held on tightly for months. In the early 1990s Bokor Hill was still one of the last strongholds of Khmer Rouge.Bokor Hill is located 42 km from the provincial town. It was erected by French colonists in 1922 during the reign of King Sisowath. Bokor was a resort location for affluent French colonists who needed a change of atmosphere.

         The Bokor Hill is 1,075 meters high, and promises good weather and magnificent views. Big trees casting shadows over the water and rocks shaped as animal figures hold particular interest for tourists. The mountain overlooks Kampot Town, Kep Beach, Preah Sihanouk Province and blue sea water.
         
         This is the main attraction in and around Kampot. Unfortunately at the time of writing it is largely closed to visitors as the road is being repaired. Bokor hill station was built by the French as a high-altitude complement to the fashionable seaside resort of Kep across the bay. Both are now faded and crumbling in a very 
         atmospheric fashion. Bokor was also the scene of fierce fighting in the '80s, with Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese troops battling it out across the mountaintop for control of the buildings and the rest of this strategic area of high ground.Perched atop Bokor Mountain, which provides a dramatic backdrop to the tranquil riverside town Kampot, sits the remnants of Cambodia’s glory days.

         An eerie ghost town marks what was once a thriving retreat for those who could afford it: the skeleton of a sprawling hotel and casino – the lost luxury evident in the lofty rooms, spacious terraces overlooking the Gulf of Thailand and a grand ballroom – a crumbling church and abandoned royal residencies all harking back to a time of decadence.
         
         Initially designed as a resort for the French during the early 20th century, thanks to its elevated heights offering a welcome reprieve from the humid heat below and sweeping views across the country, sea and beyond, Bokor Hill Station opened in 1925 after almost nine months of intense labour, which saw an estimated 1,000 men die.
         
         At its centre sat the Palace Hotel and Casino, which was often booked out by Europe’s rich and famous. Parties and dances would carry on into the early hours, with laughter and chatter ringing through the surrounding jungle.
         
         However, the colonialists’ high life was to be short-lived. When Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953, the town was quickly abandoned. Cambodia’s upper class were quick to replace the French, with Bokor thriving during the country’s heyday of the 1950s and 1960s – dubbed the Golden Age.
         
         By 1972, the Khmer Rouge had taken a firm grip on the surrounding countryside – which sits close to the border of Vietnam – with soldiers hiding out in the mountainous, rugged land. Bokor found itself abandoned by the rich for a second time. As Pol Pot’s regime strengthened, in 1975 the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia, leading to an estimated two million people being killed or dying of starvation and exhaustion.
         Inevitably, Bokor was left to wither. Because of the vantage points it offered, its remote location and proximity to Vietnam, it remained a Khmer Rouge stronghold until the early 1990s, with pockets of soldiers seeking refuge in the isolated area.

         As peace and stability spread across Cambodia, Bokor Hill Station saw something of a resurrection, with tourists trickling back up the mountain to discover the remnants of a bygone past. Despite their dilapidated state, the empty buildings remain intact and are open for visitors to explore.
         Smooth roads snake up the mountain, making the 42km drive from Kampot popular with bikers – helmets must be worn on the way up – and there are several interesting stops on the journey, from the giant female Buddha statue half-way up the mountain to the Popokvil waterfall, which is best viewed during monsoon season when it gushes through the landscape.

         Offering a great day out, a trip up Bokor Mountain is a must to catch a unique glimpse into Cambodia’s glory days, tainted by its horrific past, and coupled with great views and a refreshing temperature.</p>
